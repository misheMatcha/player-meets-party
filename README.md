## Features

### Transitioning background

Each div utilizes a keyframe to transition seamlessly between images. Since keyframes donâ€™t have intervals, percentages are calculated specifically to account for a timed interval transition.

### Authentication

With a vibrant splash page to entice potential users to join, they will need to create an account or login to access any site features.

By clicking 'Sign in' a modal will appear, which offers for a smooth transition between the splash page and logging in. Alternatively, if the user decides to create an account they will be redirected to a signup form. The signup form guides the user through the entire setup process for a more fluid and user friendly experience.

### Doubletake

Users will find potential matches every time they login. The doubletake gives users the ability to take in everything about their matches to determine if they want to continue on or pass on it.

### Profile personality

Dating profiles provide information about the match, but they don't have to be boring. Attributes are rendered with flavor to add more personality to profiles without the hassle.

      case 'marijuana':
        if(attVal === 'false'){
          hasMatchAttributes.push(`Doesn't smoke marijuana`);
        }else{
          hasMatchAttributes.push('Smokes marijuana ' + attVal);
        }
        break
      default:
        hasMatchAttributes.push(attVal);
        break;
```

### Hidden essays

Looking at matches can be overwhelming, sometimes there is too much information. Match profiles have their essay answers hidden intially to prevent information overload for the user. Allowing the user to get a quick glimpse of their potential match before jumping into their essays.
