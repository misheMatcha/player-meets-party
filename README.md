## Features
### Transitioning background
Each div utilizes a keyframe to transition seamlessly between images. Since keyframes donâ€™t have intervals, percentages are calculated specifically to account for a timed interval transition.

```css
@keyframes bgtrans-2 {
  8% { opacity: 0; }
  10%, 66% { opacity: 1; }
  68%, 100% { opacity: 0; }
}

@keyframes bgtrans-3 {
  16% { opacity: 0; }
  18%, 58% { opacity: 1; }
  60%, 100% { opacity: 0; }
}

@keyframes bgtrans-4 {
  24% { opacity: 0; }
  26%, 50% { opacity: 1; }
  52%, 100% { opacity: 0; }
}
```

### Authentication
With a vibrant splash page to entice potential users to join, they will need to create an account or login to access any site features.

By clicking 'Sign in' a modal will appear, which offers for a smooth transition between the splash page and logging in. Alternatively, if the user decides to create an account they will be redirected to a signup form. The signup form guides the user through the entire setup process for a more fluid and user friendly experience.
